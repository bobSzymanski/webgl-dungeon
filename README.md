# webgl-dungeon

### What is this I just found it here
- I am working on a 3D dungeon crawler that uses WebGL to draw simple mazes where you battle monsters and stuff.

- I started working on this in early November 2016 while I was on vacation and I knew I wanted to port my dungeon crawler code from C++ / DirectX over to webGL because javascript is pretty cool and the web is a pretty interesting platform.

## Codebase
- Javascript, using node a lot
- Webpack is used to build
- WebGL works in newer and decent modern browsers like chrome and firefox. Edge maybe in the future.
- I started using the example [here](http://www.sw-engineering-candies.com/snippets/webgl/hello-world) but there was a ton I needed to change to even get started. Maybe I'll just fork off my code once the tutorial is completely redone, so that people can use it to start, but I think giving the project as a whole might end up being a bit more useful :P


## Disclaimer??
- I don't know, this code is stuff I wrote and at this point there's nothing to really steal, copy, etc.
- Use at your own risk. Whatever, there's nothing here yet.
