### What is this I just found it here
- I am [VERY SLOWLY] working on a 3D dungeon crawler that uses WebGL to draw simple mazes where you battle monsters and stuff.

- I started working on this in early November 2016 while I was on vacation and I knew I wanted to port my dungeon crawler code from C++ / DirectX over to webGL because javascript is pretty cool and the web is a pretty interesting platform. I tend to pick this up every couple of months when I think it could use some new features or cleaning up. It should be suitable for a very barebones webGL demo.

As of Jan 2025 this project is finally further along in JS than it ever was in C++, C#, etc. Yay!

## Codebase
- Javascript, using the latest LTS version as of Jan 2025
- Webpack is used to build
- WebGL works in newer and decent modern browsers like chrome and firefox. Edge maybe in the future.
- I started using the example [here](http://www.sw-engineering-candies.com/snippets/webgl/hello-world) but there was a ton I needed to change to even get started. Maybe I'll just fork off my code once the tutorial is completely redone, so that people can use it to start, but I think giving the project as a whole might end up being a bit more useful :P
- This started out really crappy but is getting better.


## Disclaimer??
- I don't know, this code is stuff I wrote and at this point there's nothing to really steal, copy, etc.
- Use at your own risk. Whatever, there's nothing here yet.
